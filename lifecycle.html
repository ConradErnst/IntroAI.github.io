        <p> 
            Now that we’ve explored the history of the field and clarified the distinctions between Artificial Intelligence, 
            Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and related areas, as well as various architectures of Artificial Neural Networks, 
            we can shift our focus to the broader picture of building a complete AI project. Alongside neural networks, 
            we’ve also examined other widely used Machine Learning models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), 
            Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Decision Trees. But there’s much more to AI than just the underlying algorithms; 
            successful projects require a comprehensive approach from data preparation to deployment.

            The machine learning process can be broken down into a series of essential steps. 
            First, we begin with data acquisition: gathering, cleaning, organizing, and preparing our data for training. 
            This ensures the algorithm receives structured and meaningful inputs. Next, we select an appropriate model, build it, and set up the training process. 
            Throughout training, we evaluate the model’s performance, adjusting as needed to optimize its accuracy. 
            Once the model meets our standards, we finalize and deploy it. 
            In deployment, continuous monitoring and maintenance are crucial to ensure accuracy over time, as the model will need to adapt to new data and 
            changing real-world conditions.

        <h2 id="data">2.1 Data</h2>
        <p>
            Data is the foundation of any AI project. Before training a model, 
            we must gather high-quality data relevant to the task, then clean and preprocess it to ensure consistency and accuracy. 
            This often involves handling missing values, removing outliers, standardizing formats, and dividing the dataset into training, 
            validation, and test sets. Proper data preparation is essential, as it directly impacts the model's performance and generalizability. 
            Organizing the data in a structured way also helps streamline the training process, making it easier to evaluate, fine-tune, 
            and optimize the model as new data becomes available.

            AI is commonly said to have originated at the <a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/slides/dartmouth/dartmouth/node1.html" target="_blank">Dartmouth Conference in 1956</a>,
             where leading thinkers gathered to discuss the possibilities of machine intelligence. While this event popularized AI, the concept 
             of thinking machines dates back to the 1930s, with early work from pioneers like Alan Turing, John von Neumann, and Claude Shannon, 
             who laid the groundwork for modern computing and artificial intelligence.
