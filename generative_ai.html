        <h2 id="generative_ai">3.1 Overview of Generative Models</h2>
        <p>
            Generative AI models are algorithms designed to create new data samples similar to the training data they were trained on, effectively "generating" text, images, code, video, or audio.
            These models use complex mathematical transformations to capture the patterns, features, and distributions of the input data. Unlike discriminative models, which classify or label data, generative models 
            generate new, realistic samples, opening up new applications in content creation, personalized media, data augmentation, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
            The two most popular generative architectures are <strong>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</strong> and <strong>Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)</strong>. 
            GANs use a system of two neural networks—a generator that creates data samples and a discriminator that evaluates them—working against each other to improve the quality of generated content. 
            VAEs are built to encode input data into a latent space and then decode it back, making slight alterations during decoding to generate new data. In addition, <strong>transformer models</strong>, such as 
            GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), have emerged as powerful tools for text-based generative tasks, using attention mechanisms to create contextually accurate and coherent outputs.
        </p>

        <h2 id="generative_text_models">3.2 Generative Text Models</h2>
        <p>
            Generative text models, primarily based on transformers, have transformed the landscape of natural language processing (NLP) by enabling machines to generate coherent, meaningful text. These models are pre-trained on extensive corpora and fine-tuned to perform specific tasks, such as translation, summarization, and conversation. 
            They use self-attention mechanisms, which allow them to weigh the relevance of words in a sequence, maintaining context over long passages.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Architecture:</strong> Generative text models, like GPT, utilize transformers to process input data through layers that identify patterns in word relationships. Attention layers allow the model to keep track of context, enabling coherent text generation.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Text generation is used in chatbots, virtual assistants, automated journalism, summarization tools, and customer service automation. Applications include OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s T5, and many enterprise-level customer support systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Recent Advances:</strong> Only recently have large-scale computational resources and advanced architectures (such as transformers) made it feasible to train these models on vast data sets, allowing high-quality, contextually aware text generation.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="generative_code_models">3.3 Generative AI for Code</h2>
        <p>
            Generative AI for code is increasingly aiding developers by generating functional code snippets, automating repetitive tasks, and assisting with error detection. 
            Models like Codex (from OpenAI) are trained on massive amounts of code from open-source repositories, learning patterns, syntax, and logic across multiple programming languages. 
            The model's transformer architecture helps it understand code syntax and semantics, making it capable of creating functional code based on natural language prompts.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Architecture:</strong> Generative code models, such as Codex, use transformer-based architectures similar to text models but trained specifically on code. 
                This allows them to understand logical structure, variable types, and coding patterns.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Cases:</strong> These models are beneficial for software development, debugging, code refactoring, and even teaching programming. Tools like GitHub Copilot leverage Codex to assist developers within integrated development environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio Code.</li>
            <li><strong>Industry Impact:</strong> By significantly improving productivity, reducing errors, and assisting in complex code generation, generative code models are transforming software development practices, allowing developers to focus on high-level design.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="generative_image_models">3.4 Generative Image Models</h2>
        <p>
            Generative image models use GANs, VAEs, and most recently, <strong>diffusion models</strong> to create realistic images from data or even from textual descriptions. GANs use a dual-network setup where a generator tries to create convincing images while a discriminator evaluates their realism. 
            Diffusion models, on the other hand, start with random noise and iteratively refine it into a coherent image, allowing for highly realistic visual output.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Architecture:</strong> GANs consist of a generator and discriminator in a min-max game, where the generator tries to "fool" the discriminator by creating increasingly realistic images. Diffusion models follow a reverse process, refining noise until it becomes a coherent image.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Generative image models are used in media, fashion design, game development, and art. Tools like DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion have become popular for creating custom visuals from simple text prompts.</li>
            <li><strong>Recent Breakthroughs:</strong> Advances in computational power, large datasets, and architectural innovations have recently made it feasible to train high-quality generative image models that produce photorealistic images.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="generative_video_models">3.5 Generative Video Models</h2>
        <p>
            Generative video models create or manipulate video content by handling sequential frames while maintaining temporal consistency. These models can generate synthetic video from scratch, animate static images, or even create deepfake videos. 
            They are built on GANs, RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks), or transformers adapted for video, ensuring coherence between frames.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Architecture:</strong> VideoGANs, RNN-based models, and transformer variants for video maintain consistency across frames, creating a smooth video sequence. Some models employ 3D convolutions to handle spatiotemporal data.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Applications include media and entertainment, virtual reality, video editing, and advertisement. Video generation models are used in tools like DeepBrain AI, Synthesia, and D-ID for realistic or animated video creation.</li>
            <li><strong>Challenges and Recent Advances:</strong> Generating high-quality video is computationally intensive due to the need for temporal consistency. Recent models have improved video quality and usability through architectures that capture complex frame dynamics, made possible by advancements in hardware and large-scale training.</li>
        </ul>
